# Tinkercad Arduino Projects

A curated collection of Arduino projects created and tested using Tinkercad. These beginner-to-intermediate level projects cover a wide range of applications including sensors, automation, alarms and user interaction. Each folder contains the simulation setup and code to help learners build and understand electronics and embedded systems hands-on — no physical components required!




## 🔧 Repo Features


### 1.🧪 Tinkercad Simulation Ready
Projects are designed for online simulation using Tinkercad Circuits, making them easy to test without any hardware.

### 2.📁 Organized Project Structure
Each project is neatly placed in its own folder with clear naming, making it easy to find and explore specific experiments.

### 3.📚 Wide Variety of Projects
Covers 35+ projects including:

  -Sensor interfacing (ultrasonic, IR, photodiode, temperature)

  -Actuators (servo motors, buzzers, LEDs)

  -Automation systems (hand sanitizers, alarms)

  -Fun projects (piano, light demos, dimmers)

  -Microcontroller add-ons (Attiny85-based projects)

### 4.🧠 Educational Focus
Great for beginners, hobbyists, or students learning:

  -Basic electronics

  -Arduino programming (C/C++)

  -Circuit simulation and logic

### 5.💡 Real-World Applications
Many projects mimic practical systems like fire alarms, smart sanitizers, and traffic light controllers.

### 6.🧩 Expandable
Easy to build upon or modify for more advanced learning or personal experimentation.
